These are the sound requests embedded in the Q2 engine. I examined the
demo0404 sound set to see what ID sounds we might still be using accidently.

1) These files are requested in the engine, and have corresponding LUC sounds
in place, even if they're silent.

player/land1.wav
player/step1.wav
player/step2.wav
player/step3.wav
player/step4.wav
player/fall1.wav
player/fall2.wav
world/spark7.wav
world/spark6.wav
world/spark5.wav
weapons/blastf1a.wav

2) These files are requested in the engine, and have NO corresponding LUC sounds
in place, not even a silent replacement. We run the risk of triggering one of these.
Sometimes Q2 uses a sound for something completely different than what the sound is named.

weapons/bfg__f1y.wav
weapons/grenlr1b.wav
weapons/grenlf1a.wav
weapons/rocklr1b.wav
weapons/rocklf1a.wav

*fall1.wav (probably taken from the qbase2/players gender directories)
*fall2.wav (probably taken from the qbase2/players gender directories)
misc/tele1.wav

weapons/xpld_wat.wav
weapons/grenlx1a.wav
weapons/rocklx1a.wav
weapons/lashit.wav
world/ric3.wav
world/ric2.wav
world/ric1.wav

3) These files are requested in the engine, but don't appear in the Q2 pak. I don't
think we need LUC replacements because they're probably never really called.

weapons/disint2.wav
weapons/shotg2.wav
weapons/nail1.wav
weapons/rippfire.wav
weapons/plasshot.wav
weapons/disrupthit.wav
weapons/tesla.wav
